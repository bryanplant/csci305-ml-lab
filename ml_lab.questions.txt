Lab Questions
=======================
1. val it = [4,2,5,2,6,10] : int list

2. f iterates through a list and adds 1 to each element

3. this line declares a function f and matches an empty list and returns
   an empty list

4. this line matches a list and recursively adds 1 to the head and concatenates
   them together

5. false

6. tail recursion

7. Set ("best",Set ("times,",Set ("it",Set ("was",Set ("the",Set ("worst",Set ("of",Set ("times",Empty))))))))

8. In tail recursion, all of the calculations are performed first and then the
   recursive call is executed. This means that instead of allocating a stack for
   each call, the compiler can reuse the current stack frame. This means that
   tail recursion can essentially be optimized to be an iterative process
   which requires much less memory than typical recursion.

9. { and eggs green ham }

10. { and macaroni }

11. ML forces you to think differently and is helpful in better understanding
    recursion.

12. I don't like that the syntax is different from every other language I've
    used.

13. I started to enjoy the lab once I became confident with the syntax and
    general structure of ML. It was really frustrating initially but it was
    still interesting to learn a new language.

14. 6 hours

15. No.
